# Parkinson's Data Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes Parkinson's data to explore alternative diagnostic methods by examining how well non-motor features can predict the disease. These features offer a much simpler and more accessible way to diagnose and test for Parkinson's.

Most Parkinson's tests rely on detailed motor analysis. Since this method is highly involved, testing is typically conducted only after symptoms have already appeared in patients. Identifying easier and more convenient diagnostic methods could enable earlier detection without requiring patients to undergo complex procedures. This, in turn, would allow for timely intervention and treatment.
